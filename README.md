The header section shows essential details such as the VIN, year, make, and manufacturer of the vehicle. The table presents mock data representing the entire purchase history of the specific car. At the bottom, a subnavigation menu provides further options to explore the car's properties, such as title information and more. By clicking on the sales number, you can access detailed financial information related to that specific auction.
